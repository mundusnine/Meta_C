- Use [rres](https://github.com/raysan5/rres) maybe

- Bundle zig with ezc to enable building easily and create an [installer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/deploying-visual-cpp-application-by-using-the-vcpp-redistributable-package?view=msvc-170) build using [gh-actions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22266511/iexpress-command-line-example-to-create-exe-packages)

- Use with ezc to generate the metadata that would enable the visual scripting. i.e. meta_c would parse .h files and 
generate possible calls and the supported struct types that could be used.
